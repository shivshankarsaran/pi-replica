                The Mathematics fraternity observes March 14 as Pi Day each year. On March 14, 2022, Pi: The Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College conducted its first successful offline event, Pi-Logue, after two whole years. Following the tradition, this year, too, Pi-Logue consisted of a speaker session and a couple of exciting competitions. 
The event kickstarted with a talk by the honourable Dr. Ranjana Jain who graced us with her esteemed presence. She holds the position of Associate Professor at the Department of Mathematics, University of Delhi. Being a vibrant soul, she left a significant impact on the entire turnout. Everyone who had the pleasure of meeting her has praised her hard-working nature, which is evident from her academic work; operator spaces, operator algebra, and Banach spaces, to name a few. At the podium, she spoke about the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, and its applications, among which were Google’s PageRank system, the Leslie Model for population dynamics, applications in PDE as well as stability of dynamical systems. This was followed by an extremely interactive question-answer round.

                Gandhi once said, "A nation's culture resides in the hearts and the soul of its people". India is a land of diversity and our cultural diversity has most certainly shaped our nation into the marvel it is today. Taking Gandhi's thought forward, the Mathematics Department of Hansraj College organized a a dance event in spirit of the festival of Navratri titled the "Garba Raas".

The event was a complete package of stunning dance performances, joyful games, and tempting prizes. The program began with thrilling group Garba performances, followed by a few solos.

                If life were a play, getting into college would be it's curtain drop. The uncertainty that comes with moving into a completely new place with complete strangers is almost haunting. Hence, comforting that fresh start with excitement and compliance is very necessary. Our department did something similar during the month of November by organising a Bollywood themed welcome party for the new comers - Jab We Met.

The event took place in the college auditorium and was a treat to witness. Power packed performances from students of all the three years and interactive game segments to get the newbies talking made the event truly engaging. There was a lot of hooting, cheering, clapping and incessant laughter. It felt like a scene straight out of some feel good movie.

The performances ended with an ultimate dance off among the three years, which ofcourse the first years won. There were also titles presented to the freshers - Mr./Ms. Freshers and the Mr./ Ms. Best Dressed, followed by a feast and the photo session which undoubtedly remains the highlight of the day as the students truly adapted the character they chose to be and channelised it in their demeanor and there sure was an happy ending that day.

                <h1 id="fr20">Farewell '22</h1>
                Farewell 2022 was nothing less than a fun-packed day with Entertainment, Entertainment, and Entertainment!
It started off with a banger Bhangra performance and turned towards a complete dance medley execution by the first and second-year students. Along with these absolutely loved performances, the walls of the auditorium were fortunate enough to listen to so many silvery-toned instrumentals and vocals. Be it the violin or the resounding lyrics, they sure were memorable. Continuing the high spirits of the occasion, some final-year students took their sweet time and surprised everyone with their refreshing take on Bollywood choreography. It was encouraging to look at everyone dancing their hearts out, so many other students also went ahead and staged a number of solos, which was an incredible sight. All of this was equally enjoyed by the students and the faculty of the department and was followed by golden words of motivation from our professors, without whom, this event would not have been possible. The president of the department, Anvesha Kushwah, also gave a heartfelt speech and revealed what her college life meant to her and how deeply it saddened her to bid goodbyes. At this point, the general secretary, Simran Singh, came forward with a lively attitude and a positive outlook and reminded everyone that although an exciting part of life was coming to an end, it did not mean that the graduates were done with the process of discovering themselves. 
Freshers, farewells, birthdays, or anniversaries, are all incomplete without one traditional thing, the cake, and that too a large one. All the graduating seniors gathered on the stage to share those edible pieces of love with their batchmates and beloved juniors who ran around bakery shops to taste cakes to get the best of the lot.

                “Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher.”
                Our department is blessed to have many such teachers with us. So, to thank these gems, the students
                organized an online Teachers’ Day program. The event began with a warm welcome of the teachers after
                which they shared their experiences with the students. The event was planned and executed successfully
                with amazing dance performances, beautiful songs, and poems by the students, and a video message for
                the teachers. Everyone participated with great enthusiasm and the teachers enjoyed the event to their
                fullest and appreciated students for their efforts.
